projectDescription: 'Sublets.nu started out as a Northwestern-IEEE team project. Our team identified a clear problem that we all agreed could and needed to be solved; to enhance off-campus room searching experience for the Northwestern community. Currently, the project is being developed by myself. Sublets.nu focuses on streamlining the search process for a sublet and sublessee tenfold. Sublets.nu provides the control and ability to compare all available options, from costs to basic amenities to proximities to campus.'
