projectDescription: 'Are you a long-term investor? If you are anything like me, you probably had to make numerous decisions over time to decide which stocks to buy. Every now and then, I wonder - would I have been better off if I had invested in this rather than that? I built inretrospect.finance to help record investment decisions - both good ones and bad ones. You can only look back and learn if you keep a proper record - as with anything else in life. To add some fun to it, you can also share your investment records through shareable links!'
