I started my journey in computer science as a freshman in college. Little did I know, this journey would take me to the heart of Silicon Valley.

In this blog post, I share my experience as a software engineer intern at Facebook. For those who are trying to gauge if Facebook is the right fit - I hope this post will provide valuable insight. For those who are on the grind for an internship - I hope this will serve as a source of inspiration to keep going. Facebook seemed like a pipe dream, but through grit and little bit of luck, I'm really happy to have made the impossible possible.

### Application Process
In tech, the greatest challenge is landing the interview itself. The competition for a software engineering gig is borderline ridiculous, with tens of thousands of students competing for only a handful of available spots. A LinkedIn resume drop or applying through a portal will only get you so far, and many times, without an interview.

My recommendation is to at least submit your application alongside a referral from a current employee of that company. For anyone applying to Facebook, I would highly recommend asking for a referral from someone who can speak to your qualities as an engineer.

However, my journey with Facebook started out a bit differently â€” I got lucky. A recruiter reached out to me on Piazza, a learning management site used by professors at my university, after viewing my resume. Frankly, it was the unlikeliest of all places for a Facebook recruiter to be reaching out. But it happened. I was invited to interview â€” but my first attempt at cracking the coding interview was unsuccessful.

Exactly a year later, in Fall 2020, I gathered the courage to contact the same recruiter who reached out to me so many months ago. I was lucky enough to be granted a chance to interview again. This time, I was able to crack both rounds of technical interviews. A couple days after the second round, I received a call from the recruiter with a formal offer to join Facebook for Summer 2021 as a software engineer intern. It felt surreal.

### Team Selection
The team selection process for interns at Facebook is done in a manner so that both parties â€” the interns and company â€” benefit from the program. Few months prior to the internship, interns are given a survey through which they can express interest in certain pillars within Facebook. 

Specific teams are NOT provided as options to select from, but interns can express interest in certain fields (e.g. machine learning, frontend engineering, backend engineering, etc) and app pillars (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Oculus, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc). 

Once the surveys are submitted, a mysterious script magically performs team matching. From what I experienced and heard from others, the team matching script does a pretty great job of satisfying both parties. 

I was matched with the Business Messaging Lead Gen Ads team, a business-facing ads product team. It was a product used by businesses worldwide, and at the time I was matched, I felt it was an assignment I could excel in.


### A Remote Internship
Due to the ongoing pandemic, the 2021 Summer Internship Program was fully remote. Although my team was based in Menlo Park, I chose to work from Los Angeles. It made the most sense as LA shares the same time zone, has more affordable rent, and offers a lot as a city, including outdoor hikes, beautiful beaches, and great restaurants â€” especially Korean ones. My roommate was also working remotely as a software engineer intern at a different tech company, so we decided to rent an AirBnB together.

Working remotely meant that Facebook shipped its tech equipment to all interns.

Facebook also sent out intern swag a few weeks before the internship!

I set up a nice home office for myself â€” having that ultrawide monitor was extremely helpful. ðŸ˜‡

### Imposter Syndrome
Imposter syndrome is defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud. I had heard of it and read about it on countless online forums, but had never experienced imposter syndrome until my internship with Facebook. As excited as I was to work at Facebook, the thought of working at one of the worldâ€™s leading tech firms was incredibly daunting. I always had the idea that engineers working at companies like Facebook and Google were geniuses â€” I never thought I would belong at one of these companies. As the start date loomed, I became slightly overwhelmed. Would I be able to meet expectations at Facebook? What if it takes too long for me to learn the internal tools that are required for work? What if other engineers on the team think I don't deserve to be working with them? I spent hours reading about imposter syndrome on various tech forums online, and it offered a sense of comfort to know that tons of others were experiencing the same thing I was. I read a lot of advice along the lines of "There's a reason why they hired you. Believe in yourself" â€” but I still wasnâ€™t convinced.

### Ramping Up
In the blink of an eye, I finally started my internship. The first few days consisted of orientation and general training on things like source control (Facebook uses Mercurial instead of Git). Once I completed general training, I had my first official meeting with my intern manager. We spent that time getting to know each other before diving into the details of the internship. My manager prepared a very detailed document on my intern project, including general onboarding documents on our team's codebase. We also went over my goals and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), making sure that all expectations were clearly communicated. This included preferred ways of receiving feedback, working hours, and more. In general, I felt very supported by my intern manager, and the project was definitely doable within the given time frame (it was well scoped out by my manager beforehand). I outlined 2 goals for myself and communicated these very clearly to my manager:

* To receive a return offer at the end of the internship
* To get to the level where I could confidently review another team member's code and approve it (at Facebook, only one person needs to review and approve code to ship it to production).

To familiarize myself with Facebookâ€™s vast codebase, I was given a few starter tasks to give me just the right amount of exposure without becoming overwhelmed. I completed the starter tasks in a few days. Once I was finished, I moved on to the actual intern project milestones. By this point, I was feeling increasingly confident that I would be able to handle the work assigned to me. It also helped to have a supportive team who genuinely wanted me to succeed.

### Not Just an Intern
At Facebook, I never felt like I was an "intern". I had full access to the gigantic monorepo (yes, Facebook keeps all its code in a single repository), attended all the meetings with full time engineers, did code reviews, voiced out my opinions on our team's products, and had full control over my working schedule (working hours were extremely flexible even as an intern). The project that I worked on over the summer was a full-stack project, using technologies such as React for frontend and Hack/PHP for backend logic (a lot of Facebook's backend code are written in Hack/PHP, especially for product teams). I was off to a smooth start because I had quite a bit of previous experience with React. Although I never had any experience with Hack/PHP, it was not too difficult to learn as it was quite similar to other programming languages that I was already familiar with. I was able to finish my intern project in the first 7 weeks. Because I had a few weeks left, I drafted a proposal for my own mini-project that would expand on the project that I had already completed. Once I got my team's support on my proposed project, I worked with the product designer, product manager, and the content designer to actually implement the project. What I loved about interning at Facebook was that I contributed to high-impact projects. As an example, the feature that I built out was a highly requested feature by high-profile customers such as AT&T and Lexus.

### Takeaways
I learned so much during my time at Facebook. Not only that, I also left Facebook a much more confident engineer. Here are some of the takeaways:
* You don't need to be a programming prodigy that started coding at the age of 7 to work at Facebook. But you do need to be self-driven and eager to learn :)
* Soft skills are *extremely* important for engineers. Code is merely the end product that software engineers produce, and a lot more goes into making that happen.
* There are *lots* of internal tools at large tech companies like Facebook. Learning how to use them will help you become much more productive.
* Don't take existing code for granted. Just because it passed code reviews and was merged to the main trunk does not mean that the code is failproof.
* Take advantage of more senior engineers on the team, and *learn* from their code. Try to review their code, and see how they write code differently. How would you have implemented the same thing yourself and how did he/she do it differently?

### Tips for Future Facebook Interns
* Communicate, communicate, communicate. Communication is *so* important - always make sure that your intern manager is on the same page as you. This doesn't mean that you should update your manager every single hour on your progress. But I found it helpful to share my progress with my manager daily, and whenever I reached an important milestone, I communicated with my team as well. I think communication was the single most important factor in having a successful remote internship for
  me. It really makes it easy for your manager to vouch for you in the final calibration if he/she feels like they have a solid idea of the work you put in during the internship. Two other peer engineers also write reviews for you in the end, so it also helps to communicate with them as much as possible.
* Don't be afraid to ask questions when you are having trouble getting yourself unblocked.
* If you want to optimize for maximizing your chance of getting a return offer, do yourself a favor and start working on your project as early as you can.
* Once you receive comments on your code, act on it, and make sure to keep a list of items to check before submitting your code for review in the future. It's best that other engineers don't have to point out the same things over and over again.
* Remember that internship is a sprint, not a marathon. You only have ~10 weeks to prove that you can provide value to the team. That said, you won't need to be working crazy hours anyways - given that you have a sensible project to complete, you probably don't need to work 60+ hours a week. What I want to say is don't focus on having great work life balance during your internship - you can worry about that later :) Make sure you stay focused on doing whatever you can to ensure you deliver
  your project in time!
* Own your project. Remember that Facebook empowers you and treats you as a full-time employee during your internship. If you have ideas, share it with your team. Feel free to expand on the scope of your intern project. Showing initiative is one of the signals they look for - so don't be shy!
* Before you ask design questions (about the code you are writing) to your manager or peer engineers, always form your own opinion first. They will be curious on what your thoughts are before they explain their take on it. It's always a good idea to show your thought process instead of simply asking for an answer.
