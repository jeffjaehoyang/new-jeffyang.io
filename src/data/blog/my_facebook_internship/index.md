Working as a software engineer at Facebook. For quite some time, this has been my "dream". I started my journey in computer science as a freshman in college - little did I know that this journey would take me to the heart of silicon valley. In this blog post, I'd like to share my experience of working as a software engineering intern at Facebook. For those who are trying to gauge if Facebook might be a good fit - I hope this post will provide some valuable insight. For those who are in the grind for
an internship search - I hope this will serve as a source of inspiration to keep going.

### Application Process
My journey to landing an offer with Facebook was far from a typical one. Often the greatest challenge in landing a software engineering gig at one of the highly sought-after tech companies is getting the interview itself. The competition for these positions is ridiculous with tens of thousands of students competing for a handful of spots. As you can imagine, a resume drop through LinkedIn or companies' job portal probably won't get you too far. Usually getting a referral from a current
employee is your best bet (I would highly recommend anyone reading this post to get a referral if applying to Facebook). However, my journey with Facebook started out a bit differently - in some ways, I got lucky. A recruiter reached out to me on Piazza's career portal after taking a look at my resume (Piazza is a learning management site used by many professors at my university). Frankly speaking, it was the unlikeliest of all places for a Facebook university recruiter to
be reaching out. But it happened (in 2019 fall). I was handed an interview - but my first attempt at cracking the Facebook coding interview was unsuccessful. Fast-forward to 2020 fall (exactly a year later), I contacted the same recruiter that helped me through the process a year ago. Luckily, I was given a chance to interview again - this time, I was able to crack the two rounds of technical interviews. A couple days after completing the second round interview, I received a call from the recruiter with a formal offer to join Facebook for 2021 summer as a software engineer intern. It felt surreal.

### Team Selection
The team selection process for interns at Facebook is done in a manner so that both parties (i.e. the interns and the company) benefit from the internship program. A few months before the start date, interns are sent out a survey in which one can express interest in certain pillars within Facebook. Specific teams are not provided as options to select from, but interns can express interest in certain software engineering fields (e.g. machine learning, frontend engineering, backend engineering, etc) and can also declare
interest specific app pillars (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Oculus, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc). Once the surveys are submitted by interns, a mysterious script magically does the team matching. I can't speak for other interns, but from what I've seen and heard, the team matching script does a pretty good job of keeping both parties content. I was matched with Business Messeging Lead Gen Ads team. It's an ads product team that is business-facing, so I got to work on a product that was being used by
small and big businesses world-wide. I felt like I was matched with a team that I could excel in.

### A Remote Internship
Facebook decided to run its 2021 summer internship program in a fully remote capacity. Although my team was technically based in the Menlo Park office, I chose to work from the sunny city of Angels (Los Angeles)! It made sense as LA was in the same timezone as my team (PST), had more affordable rent, and had a lot to offer as a city (outdoor hikes, beautiful beaches, great restaurants - especially Korean ones). I had a roommate (a highschool friend) who was also working remotely as a software engineering intern at a different tech company, so we decided to rent an AirBnB over the summer.

Working remotely meant that Facebook had to ship tech equipments out for interns to use.

Not only that, Facebook sent out intern swags a few weeks before the internship started!

I setup a nice home office for myself - having that ultrawide monitor was extremely helpful ðŸ˜‡.

### Imposter Syndrome
Imposter syndrome is loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud - I've heard of it and read about it on so many different forums and communities online. For me personally, I've never had imposter until this point. As amazing as it felt to think that I'd be working at Facebook, the thought of working at one of the leading technology firms in the world was more daunting than I thought it'd be. I always had this idea
that engineers working at companies like Facebook and Google were geniuses - I never thought I would belong at one of these companies. As the start date loomed around the corner, I started to get slightly overwhelmed. *Would I be able to meet expectations at Facebook? What if it takes too long for me to learn the internal tools that are required for work? What if other engineers on the team think I don't deserve to be working with them?* I spent hours reading about imposter syndrome on various
tech forums online - at least lots of people in tech seemed to be experiencing imposter syndrome. I saw lots of advice along the lines of *"There's a reason why they hired you. Believe in yourself"* - but I wasn't so sure.

### Ramping Up
Like that, it started. In the first few days, I went through general training that provided helpful information on things like source control at Facebook (Facebook uses Mercurial instead of Git). Once I completed the general training, I had my first meeting with my intern manager. In the first meeting, we spent some time to get to know each other before diving into the details of the internship. My intern manager prepared a very detailed document on my intern project, including general onboarding documents on our team's codebase. We also went over goals of my internship and made sure that all expectations were clearly communicated. This included discussing preferred ways of receiving feedback, working hours, and more. In general, I felt very well supported by my intern manager, and the project definitely seemed doable within the given time frame (it was well scoped out by my manager beforehand). I set out 2 goals and communicated these very clearly with my manager:

* I wanted to receive a return offer at the end of the internship
* I wanted to be able to get to the level where I can confidently review other team member's code, and approve it (at Facebook, only one reviewer's approval is needed to ship code to production)

To get used to the vast codebase that I was being thrown into, I was given a few starter tasks which gave me just the right amount of exposure to get started on exploring the codebase by myself without feeling too overwhelmed. I was able to complete the starter tasks in a few days. Once I was done with them, I moved on to the actual intern project milestones. By this point, I was starting to feel increasingly confident that I would be able to handle the work assigned to me.
It also helped to have a team where everyone seemed to genuinely want me to succeed.

### Not Just an Intern
At Facebook, I never felt like I was an "intern". I had full access to the gigantic monorepo (yes, Facebook keeps all its code in a single repo), attended all the meetings with full time engineers, did code reviews, voiced out my opinions on our team's products, and had full control over my working schedule (working hours were extremely flexible even as an intern). The project that I worked on over the summer was a full-stack project, using technologies such as React for frontend and Hack/PHP for backend logic (yes, a lot of Facebook's backend code are written in Hack/PHP, especially for product teams). I was off to a smooth start because I had quite a bit of previous experience with React. Although I never had any experience with Hack/PHP, it was not too difficult to learn as it was quite similar to other programming languages that I was already familiar with. I was able to finish my intern project in the first 7 weeks. Because I had a few weeks left, I drafted a proposal for my own mini-project that would expand on the project that I had already completed. Once I got my team's support on my proposed project, I worked with the product designer, product manager, and the content designer to actually implement the project. What I loved about interning at Facebook was that I contributed to high-impact projects. As an example, the feature that I built out was a highly requested feature by high-profile customers such as AT&T and Lexus.

### Takeaways
I learned so much during my time at Facebook. Not only that, I also left Facebook a much more confident engineer. Here are some of the takeaways:
* You don't need to be a programming prodigy that started coding at 7 to work at Facebook. But you do need to be self-driven and eager to learn :)
* Soft skills are *extremely* important for engineers. Code is merely the end product that software engineers produce, and a lot more goes into making that happen.
* There are *lots* of internal tools at large tech companies like Facebook. Learning how to use them will help you become much more productive.
* Don't take existing code for granted. Just because it passed code reviews and was merged to the main trunk does not mean that the code is failproof.
* Take advantage of more senior engineers on the team, and *learn* from their code. Try to review their code, and see how they write code differently. How would you have implemented the same thing yourself and how did he/she do it differently?

### Tips for Future Facebook Interns
* Communicate, communicate, communicate. Communication is *so* important - always make sure that your intern manager is on the same page as you. This doesn't mean that you should update your manager every single hour on your progress. But I found it helpful to share my progress with my manager daily, and whenever I reached an important milestone, I communicated with my team as well. I think communication was the single most important factor in having a successful remote internship for
  me. It really makes it easy for your manager to vouch for you in the final calibration if he/she feels like they have a solid idea of the work you put in during the internship. Two other peer engineers also write reviews for you in the end, so it also helps to communicate with them as much as possible.
* Don't be afraid to ask questions when you are having trouble getting yourself unblocked.
* If you want to optimize for maximizing your chance of getting a return offer, do yourself a favor and start working on your project as early as you can.
* Once you receive comments on your code, act on it, and make sure to keep a list of items to check before submitting your code for review in the future. It's best that other engineers don't have to point out the same things over and over again.
* Remember that internship is a sprint, not a marathon. You only have ~10 weeks to prove that you can provide value to the team. That said, you won't need to be working crazy hours anyways - given that you have a sensible project to complete, you probably don't need to work 60+ hours a week. What I want to say is don't focus on having great work life balance during your internship - you can worry about that later :) Make sure you stay focused on do whatever you can to ensure you deliver
  your project in time!
* Own your project. Remember that Facebook empowers you and treats you as a full-time employee during your internship. If you have ideas, share it with your team. Feel free to expand on the scope of your intern project. Showing initiative is one of the signals they look for - so don't be shy!
* Before you ask design questions (about the code you are writing) to your manager or peer engineers, always form your own opinion first. They will be curious on what your thoughts are before they explain their take on it. It's always a good idea to show your thought process instead of simply asking for an answer.
