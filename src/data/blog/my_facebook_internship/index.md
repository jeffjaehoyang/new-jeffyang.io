Working as a software engineer at Facebook. For quite some time, this has been my "dream". I started my journey in computer science as a freshmen in college - little did I know that this journey would take me to the heart of silicon valley. In this blog post, I'd like to share my experience of working as a software engineering intern at Facebook. For those that are trying to see if Facebook might be a good fit - I hope this will give some valuable insight. For those who are in the grind for
an internship search - I hope this will serve as a source of inspiration to keep going.

### Application Process
My journey to landing an offer with Facebook was far from a typical one. Often the greatest challenge in landing a software engineering gig at one of the highly sought-after software companies is getting the interview itself. The competition for these positions is ridiculous with tens of thousands of students competing for a handful of spots. As you can imagine, a resume drop through LinkedIn or companies' job portal probably won't get you too far. Usually getting a referral from a current
employee is your best bet (I would highly recommend anyone reading this post to get a referral if applying to Facebook). However, my journey with Facebook started out a bit differently - in some ways, I got lucky. A recruiter reached out to me on Piazza's career portal after taking a look at my resume (Piazza is a learning management site used by many professors at my university). Frankly speaking, it was the unlikeliest of all places for a Facebook university recruiter to
be reaching out. But it happened (in 2019 fall). I was handed an interview - but my first attempt at cracking the Facebook coding interview was unsuccessful. Fast-forward to 2020 fall (exactly a year later), I contacted the same recruiter that helped me through the process a year ago. Luckily, I was given a chance to interview again - this time, I was able to crack the two rounds of technical interviews. A couple days after completing the second round interview, I received a call from the recruiter with a formal offer to join Facebook for 2021 summer as a software engineer intern. It felt surreal.

### Team Selection
The team selection process for interns at Facebook is done in a manner so that both parties (i.e. the interns and the company) benefit from the internship program. A few months before the start date, interns are sent out a survey in which one can express interest in certain pillars within Facebook. Specific teams are not provided as options to select from, but interns can express interest in certain software engineering fields (e.g. machine learning, frontend engineering, backend engineering, etc) and can also declare
interest specific app pillars (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Oculus, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc). Once the surveys are submitted by interns, a mysterious script magically does the team matching. I can't speak for other interns, but from what I've seen and heard, the team matching script does a pretty good job of keeping both parties content. I was matched with Business Messeging Lead Gen Ads team. It's an ads product team that is business-facing, so I got to work on a product that was being used by
small and big businesses world-wide. I felt like I was matched with a team that I could excel in.

### A Remote Internship
Facebook decided to run its 2021 summer internship program in a fully remote capacity. My team was based in the Menlo Park office, but I did not go into office - in fact, I chose to work from the sunny city of Angels (Los Angeles)! It made sense as LA was in the same timezone as my team (PST), had more affordable rent, and had a lot to offer as a city (outdoor hikes, beautiful beaches, great restaurants - especially Korean). I had a roommate (a highschool friend) who was also working remotely as a software engineering intern at a different tech company, so we decided to rent an AirBnB over the summer.

Working remotely meant that Facebook had to ship tech equipments out for interns to use.

Not only that, Facebook sent out intern swags a few weeks before the internship started!

I setup a nice home office for myself - having that ultrawide monitor was extremely helpful ðŸ˜‡.

### Imposter Syndrome
Imposter syndrome is loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud - I've heard of it and read about it on so many different forums and communities online.
