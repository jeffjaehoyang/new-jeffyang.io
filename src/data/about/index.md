## Hi there! I'm Jeff ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! I created this blog for myself to freely share ideas and document my progress as a software engineer. I have benefited immensely from the generous and welcoming programming community who share their knowledge with others. I hope to replicate that learning experience for others through this blog!
