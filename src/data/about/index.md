### Recording life, code, and passion.

Hey, I'm Jeff 👋

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! I created this blog for myself to freely share thoughts and document my progress as a software engineer. I have benefited immensely from the generous and welcoming programming community who share their knowledge with others. I hope to replicate that learning experience for others through this blog!

#### What technologies interest me?

I am still in the process of exploring many different areas of software engineering. So far, I've found passion in delivering high quality end-products to users and in the art of finding the right balance between business and engineering - although ultimately, I believe that *software engineers also exist to add value to businesses*.
I especially enjoy exploring web technologies. I love how the technologies related to the web are rapidly developing and constantly changing for the better. Bottom-line: still have lots to learn 😉
