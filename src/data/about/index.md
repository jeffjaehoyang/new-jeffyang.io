### Recording life, code, and passion.

Hi, I'm Jeff ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! I created this blog for myself to freely share thoughts and document my progress as a software engineer. I have benefited immensely from the generous and welcoming programming community who share their knowledge with others. I hope to replicate that learning experience for others through this blog!
